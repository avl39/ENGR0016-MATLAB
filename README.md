# Avery Law ENGR 0016: Intro to Engineering Computing with Dr. Matthew Kropf

## README

### What is this?

This repo is supposed to be everything that I've done in this course from the earliest point I started taking notes (February 29th, I know I should've started taking notes earlier sue me). Within it are my raw notes from class, some homework examples(hopefully he chances them otherwise yikes, I just gave you answers, credit me if you do use my code), and a document that I've coined as my *Term Masterlist* with all of the useful terms and phrases that I think you should know.

Most of the stuff in these folders is going to be useful to some degree, some more than others. If you use this repo properly, a vast majority of your time is going to be spent in the `Resources` folder, as that's where my notes and the Term List are all located.

### Why make this in the first place?

So first and foremost, I don't like OneDrive and I hate storing stuff in there, so I avoid it as much as I can. The next best alternative to that was VSCode with the MATLAB extension, and github was the easiest file sharing solution that I had available to me. Google Drive is helpful but lacks the integration that github has, and I much more appreciate the streamlined workflow of github over needing to constantly upload and update stuff in a Drive folder.

I guess more applicable to you, I believe in helping people. I know a lot of people struggle with programming, engineers especially. We're used to doing tangible work, being able to actually *see* what we're doing and programming is a very big step away from that. It can be really frustrating at the beginning, especially if this course is your first time ever programming. MATLAB can be somewhat obtuse if it's your first language, or archaic if you're coming from another more streamlined language. More than anything, the Command Line/Command Window can be a little jarring for a lot of people and I don't blame you for it. Hopefully with this guide and these resources, things can be made a little easier for you.

### Some misc notes

You can redistribute this as you see fit, this repo is public for a reason. Feel free to use my code as an example for anything as long as you cite me as a starting point and who knows, maybe if you point someone in my direction that someone will become another engineer who doesn't hate programming as much.

I'll try to keep this repo as updated as I can with homework assignments, notes, other sanity-breaking things, but I might fall a little bit behind. The only thing I can guarantee is that my notes should be within a week of the lecture in which they were covered, that shouldn't be too hard for me to keep up with. Hopefully. Maybe if I'm actually able to lock in for the rest of the semester I don't have to worry as much. That remains to be seen. If you're reading this after the 2024 Spring semester, this section probably makes no sense to you but oh well. Pretend it doesn't exist, I guess.

Good Luck!
