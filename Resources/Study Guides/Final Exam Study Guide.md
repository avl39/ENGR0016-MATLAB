# ENGR 0016: Intro to Engineering Analysis Final Exam Review

## README

This is supposed to be a study guide for what I expect to be on the final exam. It might not cover every single topic that will be on the exam because I'm not a fortune teller, but this should serve as a pretty good template for what you want to be studying for the final exam.

Don't take everything that's in there as gospel. I will do my best to make sure there are no errors in this document but it is almost inevitable that something will slip through the cracks. If you want to, you can use this document as your way of studying or reviewing content. There will be no practice problems in this document so be aware of that. If you do want practice, my recommendation would be to rebuild your scripts from prior assignments, namely the curve fitting assignment and the curve fitting script. Those two are most likely the scripts that we will need on the final so making sure that those scripts are relatively robust is important so you don't spend time trying to rebuild them during the exam. If you need examples for any of those scripts, they can be found in the [homework folder](https://github.com/avl39/ENGR0016-MATLAB/tree/main/Homework%20Assignments) in their respective folders.

This study guide is going to be split into several sections, one section for each topic that Dr. Kropf mentioned in class on 18.4.24. Again, this is not an exhaustive list of all of the things that you should know, just a starting point for where to start studying. If you need more resources/review on each of the topics covered in class, see my [Notes](https://github.com/avl39/ENGR0016-MATLAB/blob/main/Resources/Notes.md) in the GitHub. Good luck and happy studying!
